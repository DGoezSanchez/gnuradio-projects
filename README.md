# gnuradio-Projects
This repository shares my experience in Software Defined Radio (SDR), and I have updated it with relevant projects or links in the field. It provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing SDR using the GNU Radio Toolkit and includes easy-to-use examples to help newcomers get started in the field. Some guides are in Spanish, as they are materials created for my work as a teacher in this field when I taught at the  Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano de Medellín.
