# gnuradio-projects
This repository shares my experience in Software Defined Radio (SDR), and I have updated it with relevant projects or links in the field. It provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing SDR using the GNU Radio Toolkit and includes easy-to-use examples to help newcomers get started in the field. Some guides are in Spanish, as they are materials created for my work as a teacher in this field when I taught at the  Instituto Tecnológico Metropolitano de Medellín.

## Ettus Research Official Repository

To install UHD drivers, run the following commands:

- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ettusresearch/uhd
  
- sudo apt-get update
  
- sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev uhd-host

## Download UHD Firmware Images
Download the required UHD firmware images with the following command:
- sudo /usr/lib/uhd/utils/uhd_images_downloader.py

## UHD Tools and Utilities
Commands Overview:

- uhd_find_devices: Detects connected UHD devices.
  
- uhd_fft -f 100M -s40M: A simple spectrum analyzer tool using a connected UHD device.
  
- uhd_rx_cfile: Records an I/Q sample stream to a file for later offline analysis.
  
- uhd_rx_nogui: Receives and plays incoming signals on your audio device (demodulates AM and FM signals).
  
- uhd_siggen_gui: A basic signal generator capable of creating common signals (e.g., sine, sweep, square, noise).

# GNU Radio installation using conda
## 1) Create an environment for GNU Radio
- conda create -n gnuradio
- conda activate gnuradio
- conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
- conda config --env --set channel_priority strict

## 2) Install GNU Radio from conda-forge
- conda install gnuradio
If you want a specific version of the gnuradio package
- conda install gnuradio=3.8

To upgrade all non-Python packages in your environment to their latest available versions, use the upgrade command
- conda upgrade --all
  
## To enable Python code editing with GNU Radio libraries, install JupyterLab within the environment:  
- conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab

# Using GNU Radio from conda
- conda run uhd_find_devices
- python ./anaconda3/envs/gnuradio/lib/uhd/utils/uhd_images_downloader.py
  
Access the Anaconda tools and locate the GNU Radio virtual environment. Activate the environment and ensure that GNU Radio and JupyterLab function correctly with the GNU Radio libraries.
